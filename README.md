# SSD_pytorch
SSD experiments with pytorch 

this repository is heavily depend on this implementation [ssd.pytorch](https://github.com/midasklr/SSD.Pytorch).
I try to train SSD512 on bdd100k dataset.
And compare wloss map with this repo.
Then I will add some backbone such as resnet50,efficientnet, add some model such as rfb,cfe,m2det
